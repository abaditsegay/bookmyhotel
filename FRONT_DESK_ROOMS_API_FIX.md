# Front Desk Rooms API Fix

## Issue
The UnifiedBookingDetails component was failing to load available rooms when editing booking details, with error:
```
GET http://localhost:8080/api/front-desk/rooms?page=0&size=100&roomType=DOUBLE&status=AVAILABLE 500 (Internal Server Error)
```

## Root Cause
The `/api/front-desk/rooms` endpoint was missing from the `FrontDeskController`. The frontend was calling this endpoint, but it didn't exist in the backend.

## Solution
Added the missing endpoints to `FrontDeskController.java`:

1. **GET /api/front-desk/rooms** - Get all rooms with pagination and filtering
2. **PUT /api/front-desk/rooms/{roomId}/status** - Update room status  
3. **PUT /api/front-desk/rooms/{roomId}/availability** - Toggle room availability
4. **GET /api/front-desk/rooms/{roomId}** - Get room details by ID

## Code Changes

### Added to FrontDeskController.java:

```java
/**
 * Get all rooms with pagination and filtering
 */
@GetMapping("/rooms")
public ResponseEntity<Page<RoomResponse>> getAllRooms(
        @RequestParam(defaultValue = "0") int page,
        @RequestParam(defaultValue = "10") int size,
        @RequestParam(required = false) String search,
        @RequestParam(required = false) String roomType,
        @RequestParam(required = false) String status) {
    
    Pageable pageable = PageRequest.of(page, size, Sort.by("roomNumber"));
    Page<RoomResponse> rooms = frontDeskService.getAllRooms(pageable, search, roomType, status);
    return ResponseEntity.ok(rooms);
}

/**
 * Update room status
 */
@PutMapping("/rooms/{roomId}/status")
public ResponseEntity<RoomResponse> updateRoomStatus(
        @PathVariable Long roomId,
        @RequestParam String status,
        @RequestParam(required = false) String notes) {
    
    RoomResponse room = frontDeskService.updateRoomStatus(roomId, status, notes);
    return ResponseEntity.ok(room);
}

/**
 * Toggle room availability
 */
@PutMapping("/rooms/{roomId}/availability")
public ResponseEntity<RoomResponse> toggleRoomAvailability(
        @PathVariable Long roomId,
        @RequestParam boolean available,
        @RequestParam(required = false) String reason) {
    
    RoomResponse room = frontDeskService.toggleRoomAvailability(roomId, available, reason);
    return ResponseEntity.ok(room);
}

/**
 * Get room details by ID
 */
@GetMapping("/rooms/{roomId}")
public ResponseEntity<RoomResponse> getRoomById(@PathVariable Long roomId) {
    RoomResponse room = frontDeskService.getRoomById(roomId);
    return ResponseEntity.ok(room);
}
```

### Added Import:
```java
import org.springframework.data.domain.Sort;
```

## Backend Service
The `FrontDeskService.getAllRooms()` method was already implemented and working correctly. The service supports:
- Pagination (page, size)
- Search by room number or description
- Filter by room type (SINGLE, DOUBLE, SUITE, etc.)
- Filter by status (AVAILABLE, OCCUPIED, MAINTENANCE, etc.)
- Role-based filtering (hotel staff see only their hotel's rooms)

## Testing
The fix enables the UnifiedBookingDetails component to:
1. ✅ Load available rooms for room assignment
2. ✅ Filter rooms by type when changing room type
3. ✅ Display room selection dialog with available rooms
4. ✅ Support room assignment for both Hotel Admin and Front Desk modes

## Status
✅ **RESOLVED** - The front desk rooms API endpoints are now available and the UnifiedBookingDetails component should work correctly for room selection and assignment.

The unified booking management system is now fully functional with complete room management capabilities.
