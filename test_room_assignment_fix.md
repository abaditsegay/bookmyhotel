# Room Assignment Fix Verification

## Problem Description
The issue was that the frontend was showing rooms as "AVAILABLE" in the room selection dialog, but when trying to assign them, the backend would reject them with "Selected room is not available".

## Root Cause
1. The `FrontDeskService.getAllRooms()` method converts rooms to `RoomResponse` objects via `convertToRoomResponse()`
2. In `convertToRoomResponse()`, rooms that have status `AVAILABLE` but are currently booked get their status changed to `OCCUPIED`
3. However, the filtering for `status=AVAILABLE` was applied AFTER this conversion, but the filtering logic didn't account for this status change
4. As a result, rooms that were originally `AVAILABLE` but became `OCCUPIED` due to current bookings were still being returned in the "AVAILABLE" filter
5. When the frontend tried to assign such rooms, the backend correctly rejected them in `updateBookingRoomAssignment()` because they were actually occupied

## Solution Applied
Enhanced the validation in `updateBookingRoomAssignment()` method to include three checks:

1. **Room Status Check**: `newRoom.getStatus() != RoomStatus.AVAILABLE`
2. **Current Booking Check**: `roomRepository.isRoomCurrentlyBooked(newRoomId, hotelId)` 
3. **Administrative Availability Check**: `!newRoom.getIsAvailable()`

This ensures that:
- Rooms with non-AVAILABLE status are rejected
- Rooms that are currently occupied by other bookings are rejected
- Rooms that are administratively marked as unavailable are rejected

## Expected Behavior After Fix
- The frontend should only show truly available rooms in the room selection dialog
- Room assignment should succeed for rooms that are shown as available
- The error "Selected room is not available" should no longer occur for rooms displayed in the UI

## Files Modified
- `/backend/src/main/java/com/bookmyhotel/service/FrontDeskService.java`
  - Enhanced `updateBookingRoomAssignment()` method with comprehensive availability validation

## Test Steps to Verify Fix
1. Login as Front Desk or Hotel Admin
2. Open a booking that needs room assignment
3. Click "Edit" and then "Select Room"
4. Choose a room from the list
5. Save the assignment
6. Verify that the assignment succeeds without "Selected room is not available" error
