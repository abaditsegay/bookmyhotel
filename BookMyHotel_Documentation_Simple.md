#### Key Indexes

```sql
-- Booking system indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_reservations_tenant_hotel ON reservations(tenant_id, hotel_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_reservations_dates ON reservations(check_in_date, check_out_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_reservations_status ON reservations(status, tenant_id);

-- Shop system indexes  
CREATE INDEX idx_shop_orders_tenant_hotel ON shop_orders(tenant_id, hotel_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_shop_orders_status ON shop_orders(status, tenant_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_products_tenant_active ON products(tenant_id, is_active);
```

#### Query Performance Optimization
