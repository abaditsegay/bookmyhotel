# Service Layer Hotel-Scoped Refactor Progress

## 🎯 Overview
Converting service layer from tenant-based operations to hotel-scoped operations to align with the new hotel-centric repository architecture.

## ✅ **Completed Services**

### 1. **HousekeepingService** - ✅ COMPLETED
**Changes Made:**
- ✅ All methods converted from `tenantId` to `hotelId` parameters
- ✅ Added hotel verification for all operations
- ✅ Updated repository method calls to use hotel-based queries
- ✅ Added proper hotel relationship validation

**Key Method Updates:**
- `createTask(Long hotelId, ...)` - Now hotel-scoped with room-hotel validation
- `getAllTasks(Long hotelId)` - Hotel-specific task retrieval
- `getTasksByStatus(Long hotelId, status)` - Hotel-filtered status queries
- `assignTask(Long hotelId, ...)` - Hotel-verified task assignment
- `completeTask(Long hotelId, ...)` - Hotel-scoped task completion
- `getAllStaff(Long hotelId)` - Hotel-specific staff management
- `getTaskCountByStatus(Long hotelId, ...)` - Hotel-scoped statistics

**Repository Calls Updated:**
- `findByHotelIdOrderByCreatedAtDesc()` ✅
- `findByHotelIdAndStatusOrderByCreatedAtDesc()` ✅
- `findByHotelIdAndAssignedStaffOrderByCreatedAtDesc()` ✅
- `countByHotelIdAndStatus()` ✅

### 2. **MaintenanceService** - 🔄 PARTIALLY COMPLETED
**Changes Made:**
- ✅ `createTask()` method updated to hotel-scoped
- ✅ Removed redundant `tenantId` parameter
- ✅ Added room-hotel relationship validation
- ✅ Updated basic query methods to hotel-scoped

**Still Needs:**
- 🔄 Complete remaining methods in the service
- 🔄 Update all statistical and reporting methods
- 🔄 Update task assignment and completion methods

### 3. **RoomChargeService** - 🔄 PARTIALLY COMPLETED  
**Changes Made:**
- ✅ `createRoomCharge()` method updated to hotel-scoped
- ✅ Removed TenantContext dependency
- ✅ Added hotel verification for reservations and shop orders

**Still Needs:**
- 🔄 Update remaining CRUD methods
- 🔄 Update pagination and search methods
- 🔄 Update payment-related methods

## 🔄 **In Progress Services**

### 4. **BookingService** - 📋 NEEDS ATTENTION
**Current State:** Complex service with mixed tenant/hotel logic
**Required Changes:**
- 🔄 Remove TenantContext usage where possible
- 🔄 Ensure hotel-based validation throughout booking process
- 🔄 Update reservation repository calls to hotel-scoped methods

### 5. **ShopOrderService** - 📋 PENDING
**Required Changes:**
- 🔄 Convert from tenant-based to hotel-based operations
- 🔄 Update all repository method calls
- 🔄 Add hotel verification for all operations

### 6. **ProductService** - 📋 PENDING
**Required Changes:**
- 🔄 Convert from tenant-based to hotel-based operations
- 🔄 Update product management to be hotel-scoped
- 🔄 Update inventory and pricing methods

## ❌ **Pending Services**

### 7. **ReservationService** - 📋 NOT FOUND
**Status:** Service file may not exist or be named differently
**Action:** Need to locate reservation management service

### 8. **RoomService** - 📋 PENDING
**Required Changes:**
- 🔄 Convert room management to hotel-scoped
- 🔄 Update room availability and pricing methods
- 🔄 Ensure proper hotel relationship validation

### 9. **StaffScheduleService** - 📋 PENDING
**Required Changes:**
- 🔄 Convert scheduling to hotel-scoped operations
- 🔄 Update staff assignment methods
- 🔄 Hotel-based schedule queries

## 🚨 **Critical Issues Identified**

### **Repository Method Mismatches**
- Some services call repository methods that no longer exist
- Need to ensure all repository calls match new hotel-based signatures

### **Hotel Resolution**
- Services need consistent way to get Hotel entity references
- Added HotelRepository dependency where needed

### **Validation Logic**
- All hotel-scoped operations now include hotel ownership verification
- Prevents cross-hotel data access

## 📊 **Progress Statistics**

- **Completed Services:** 1 (HousekeepingService)
- **Partially Completed:** 2 (MaintenanceService, RoomChargeService)  
- **Pending Services:** ~6-8 remaining
- **Overall Progress:** ~25% completed

## 🎯 **Next Steps Priority**

### **High Priority (Compilation Blockers)**
1. **Complete MaintenanceService** - Finish remaining methods
2. **Complete RoomChargeService** - Update all CRUD operations
3. **BookingService** - Critical for application functionality

### **Medium Priority (Feature Completion)**  
4. **ShopOrderService** - Complete e-commerce functionality
5. **ProductService** - Hotel inventory management
6. **RoomService** - Room management operations

### **Low Priority (Administrative)**
7. **StaffScheduleService** - Staff management
8. **Other utility services** - As needed

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Notes**

### **Method Signature Pattern**
```java
// OLD (tenant-based)
public Entity someMethod(String tenantId, Long entityId, ...)

// NEW (hotel-based)  
public Entity someMethod(Long hotelId, Long entityId, ...)
```

### **Validation Pattern**
```java
// Verify entity belongs to hotel
if (!entity.getHotel().getId().equals(hotelId)) {
    throw new RuntimeException("Entity not found for this hotel");
}
```

### **Repository Call Pattern**
```java
// OLD
repository.findByTenantIdAndStatus(tenantId, status)

// NEW  
repository.findByHotelIdAndStatus(hotelId, status)
```

## ✅ **Quality Assurance**

### **Validation Implemented**
- ✅ Hotel ownership verification for all operations
- ✅ Cross-hotel data access prevention
- ✅ Proper error messages for unauthorized access

### **Performance Considerations**
- ✅ Hotel-based indexing in repositories
- ✅ Efficient hotel-scoped queries
- ✅ Reduced need for tenant context lookups

The refactoring is progressing well with solid foundations established. The completed services demonstrate the correct patterns for hotel-scoped operations that can be applied to the remaining services.
